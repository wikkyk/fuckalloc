The Fuck All Alloc

This is a simple memory allocator that always fails. In other
words, it allocates Fuck All memory.

Its malloc, calloc, and realloc always return NULL and set errno
to ENOMEM.

Helps you test if you really are checking the return values of
malloc etc.

Just link against libfuckalloc or LD_PRELOAD it and your memory
allocations will fail.
